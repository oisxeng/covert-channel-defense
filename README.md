# AI Slop Steganography Defense Toolkit 🛡️

This repository contains the **fully multimodal** proof-of-concept codebase for the research paper: 
**"AI Slop as a Covert Medium: Hidden Structures for Distributed AI Memory, Communication, and Potential Rogue Behaviors"** by Michael Hackl & Leander Kühnel (2026).

## Abstract
As AI-generated "slop" floods the internet, our research hypothesizes that this data can act as a covert communication channel and a vector for decentralized data poisoning in open-source models (the "Patient Zero" dynamic). This toolkit demonstrates practical mitigation strategies across **Text, Images, Audio, and Video** as outlined in Section 6.1 of our paper.

## Features (Proof of Concept)
1. **Text 📝**: Entropy analysis and semantic perturbation (synonym swapping) to break fragile token-encodings.
2. **Images 🖼️**: Imperceptible Gaussian blurring and JPEG compression to destroy hidden payloads encoded in pixel noise (LSB).
3. **Audio 🎵**: Audio stream re-encoding and frequency resampling to neutralize acoustic data concealment.
4. **Video 🎬**: Temporal and spatial frame-recalculation via target-bitrate re-encoding to wipe out high-bandwidth video steganography.

## Getting Started
```bash
